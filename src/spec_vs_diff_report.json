  "summary": "The diff introduces a new shared Card-based wrapper component (TabPageCard) and updates both Opportunities and RadarDashboard to import/use Card primitives and TabPageCard, aligning with the requested goal of consistent Card-based tab layout. Due to truncation of the key render sections in both modified tab files, some acceptance-criteria details (e.g., removal of redundant outer padding wrappers) cannot be conclusively verified from the provided diff summary alone.",
